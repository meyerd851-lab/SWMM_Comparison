Interactive Map: Visualizes added, removed, changed, and unchanged elements with Leaflet basemaps.

Detailed Table View: Shows line-by-line changes with side-by-side popups for each element.

Hydrograph Support: Compares RTK parameters by month and duration bin with delta calculations.

Session Save/Load: Exports or restores comparison sessions via .json files.

Excel Export: Generates a formatted .xlsx summary of all detected differences.

Offline Use: Runs entirely client-side in any modern browser.

**Technologies**

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Mapping: Leaflet.js, proj4.js

Hosting: GitHub Pages

Pyodide: Allows Python code to execute natively in the browser, letting the app perform complex model comparisons locally on your device without any external processing.
